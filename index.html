        <p>Access <a href="file1_exists.html">'file1_exists.html'</a> from the private repository. The stub file exists in the public repository and the corresponding private file exists in the private repository.</p>

        <p>Attempt to access <a href="no_file.html">'no_file.html'</a> from the private repository. The stub file exists in the public repository but there's no corresponding file in the private repository.</p>

        <p>Use <a href="explicit.html">'explicit.html'</a> to load 'file1_exists.html' from the private repository. The stub file 'explicit.html' exists but explicitly identifies 'file1_exists.html' as the file to load from the private repository.</p>

        <p>Use <a href="file2_exists.html">'explicit_no_SSO.html'</a> to load 'file2_exists.html' from the private repository but without caching credentials. The stub file exists in the public repository and the corresponding private file exists in the private repository, but the stub file explicitly includes a flag to not cache credentials.</p>

        <p>Access the <a href="login.html">login</a> page to authenticate to the private repository without actually loading a private file, and cache credentials. This is useful only to establish authentication for SSO.</p>

        <p>Access the <a href="logout.html">logout</a> page to clear cached credentials.</p>
